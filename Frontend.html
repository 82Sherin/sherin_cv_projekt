        <p>Full Stack Developer Program — with a Unique Focus on Security

            I completed a 400-credit Higher Vocational Education program in Full Stack Development at
            Företagsuniversitetet, designed to provide both the depth and breadth required to manage and execute all
            parts of an IT project.<br>
            The program emphasized building secure, scalable, and testable IT solutions—skills that are highly relevant
            for roles such as programmer, IT consultant, or software developer.<br>
            <br>
            The training began with a solid foundation in software development and advanced step by step, enabling
            students to independently design and deliver complete IT solutions.<br>
            <br>
            We worked extensively with modern technologies and frameworks, including:<br>
            <br>
            HTML, CSS, and responsive web design<br>
            <br>
            React and Angular for front-end development<br>
            <br>
            Node.js, Java, and Spring for back-end applications<br>
            <br>
            Agile methodologies and version control systems<br>
            <br>
            SQL and NoSQL databases<br>
            <br>
            And a strong focus on information security and system reliability<br>
            <br>
            What truly made the program unique was its security perspective—an area often overlooked in similar
            programs—and its flexible study format (75% pace over 2.5 years), allowing students to gain professional
            experience alongside their studies.<br>
            <br>
            Around 50–60% of the coursework involved hands-on programming, striking the right balance between theory and
            practical application.<br>
            <br>
            Collaboration with Leading Companies<br>
            <br>
            The program also included LIA (internship) placements at major organizations, providing valuable real-world
            experience.<br>
            Through Företagsuniversitetet’s strong partnerships, students gained access to companies such as Truecaller,
            Atea, the Swedish Armed Forces, Region Stockholm, and the Swedish National Agency for Education
            (Skolverket).<br>
            <br>
            This professional collaboration offered the opportunity to specialize in areas of personal interest and
            build networks in both consulting firms and global organizations.<br>
            <br>
            Preparing for the Future<br>
            <br>
            The Full Stack Developer program is designed for those with a genuine passion for IT and a drive to build
            future-ready skills.
            Becoming a full stack developer means mastering both front-end and back-end development—a challenge that
            makes you especially valuable in today’s job market.<br>
            <br>
            Full stack developers are often described as “unicorns”—rare, versatile, and highly sought after.
            This program was created to train exactly that kind of professional: someone capable of seeing the bigger
            picture, bridging multiple technologies, and developing secure, high-quality digital solutions.<br>
