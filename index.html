        <p>My name is Sherin, and I am 43 years old. I am a dedicated and goal-oriented professional with a strong
            background in the beauty and fashion industry. For many years, I worked as a hairdresser, hairstylist, and
            makeup artist, during which I had the opportunity to travel internationally, participate in fashion weeks,
            and collaborate with people from diverse cultural and professional backgrounds. These experiences allowed me
            to develop creativity, precision, and strong communication skills—qualities that I value deeply. <br>
            <br>
            During the pandemic, I found myself reflecting on my long-term goals and personal development. As my
            children grew older, I realized that I would soon have greater freedom to explore new directions in life. I
            have always dreamt of working remotely and having the flexibility to live and travel abroad, which inspired
            me to seek a career that aligns with this vision. <br>
            <br>
            In that period, I transitioned into a new role as a coordinator and producing for commercial film projects.
            Shifting from a physically active profession to one requiring extensive computer-based work was a
            significant change, but I discovered how fulfilling it was to use analytical and creative thinking to solve
            complex problems. This experience awakened my interest in programming and technology. <br>
            <br>
            I have always enjoyed mathematics and logical reasoning, and I find great satisfaction in problem-solving.
            Over the years, I have also maintained and designed websites, including my own and one for a small business.
            I was fascinated by the process of combining creativity with structured, technical work, and this
            realization led me to pursue programming more seriously. <br>
            <br>
            Although I did not complete my high school education initially, I have since returned to my studies and
            completed the courses for further education. I am now determined to build a new career in
            programming and software development. I approach this path with a strong sense of purpose, discipline, and
            commitment to excellence. <br>
            <br>
            Colleagues and friends within the industry have encouraged me to pursue this direction, emphasizing that my
            creative problem-solving skills, adaptability, and motivation make me well-suited for the field. <br>
            <br>
            Through this program (full stack developer), I aim to deepen my technical expertise, strengthen my
            analytical thinking, and
            continue growing as a professional who can merge creativity with technology. My long-term goal is to
            contribute meaningfully to projects that make a difference while building a career that allows freedom,
            innovation, and continuous learning. <br>
