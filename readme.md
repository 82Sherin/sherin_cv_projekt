## 🧩 Website Structure

The HTML structure is organized with a linked external stylesheet for styling.  
Inside the body, the layout is divided into several key sections:

- **Header** – Contains the logo and a short description about me and my company.  
- **Aside (fixed)** – Displays my contact information and my photo, which also functions as a home button.  
- **Navigation** – Includes links to my previous work and projects.  
- **Main Section** – Provides detailed information about me and my professional background.  
- **Footer** – Contains the copyright notice.

- **CSS3** – for design, layout, and styling

## 🎨 CSS / Styling Notes

For this project, I have created separate CSS files for the **Home**, **Frontend/Backend**, and **Coordinator** pages.  
Each element was built individually this time. I am aware that there is some code repetition that could have been moved to a common root file, but as this is my first project, this approach helped me understand how each element works.

- On the **Home** page, I intentionally avoided using Flexbox to fully understand the basics of layout.  
- On the **Coordinator** page, most of the layout is built with **Flexbox**.  
- In the future, I plan to redo the **Hairstylist** and **Makeup Artist** sections by adding images directly instead of linking to external sites, and then build those layouts with **CSS Grid** for better structure and flexibility.

This project was a great learning experience to explore different layout techniques and understand the fundamentals of CSS.
